        <p> <em>Lover of math, dancing, and <strong>rainbows.</strong></em> </p>
        <p>I love to create beautiful things. Glitter. Pixelated Stars. Bright colors. 90s-2000s nostalgia. That's what I live for.</p>

      <h3>Education:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>I attended a semester of <a href="https://valenciacollege.edu">Valencia College</a> in Orlando, FL in 2017.</li>
      <li>I took the <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat">SAT</a> in 2018 and attended <a href="https://www.colum.edu">Columbia College Chicago</a> in Chicago, IL for a semester for Television. I quickly realized that was not what I wanted to do at all and knew I wanted to study something in STEM bc of my deep deep love and passion for math and problem solving.</li>
